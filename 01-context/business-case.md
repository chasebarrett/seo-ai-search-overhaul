# Business Case

Improving SCARPA North America’s native SEO directly strengthens its digital footprint, reduces dependency on paid media, and improves long-term customer acquisition efficiency.

The emergence of AI-driven search accelerated this need.

### Key Drivers
- AI search is expected to surpass traditional search by early 2028
- AI search traffic is growing rapidly and behaves differently than traditional search
- AI visitors demonstrate higher intent and engagement (worth up to 4.4x more)
- Search engines increasingly summarize content instead of ranking links
- Poorly structured PDP copy risks invisibility in AI-generated answers

### Strategic Bet
If SCARPA content could be made:
- Clear
- Structured
- Intent-driven
- Brand-consistent

…then it would perform better across **both human and AI consumption paths**.
