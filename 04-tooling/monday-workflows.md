# Monday.com Workflows

This document describes how the project’s **process and governance decisions** were operationalized in Monday.com. Monday.com served as the operational backbone of the project.

- For the Agile/Kanban operating model, see: `03-workflow/process-overview.md`
- For decision rights and quality gates, see: `03-workflow/governance.md`

The purpose of Monday.com here was not “project tracking”—it was **system visibility**, **WIP control**, and **shared accountability**.

Monday was chosen as the project management software due to stakeholders’ existing familiarity with the tool.

## 📋 Board Structure

Each product was represented as an individual item, tracking:

- Product Name
- Status
- Overall Progress
- Descriptions (an attachment containing all four description types)

Keeping all four descriptions attached to a single product item ensured reviewers evaluated content holistically rather than approving copy in isolation.

## 🧠 Workflow Stages

Typical stages included:
- Drafting
- Stakeholder Review
- Revision
- Approved
- Live in Production

This made progress visible and bottlenecks explicit.

---

## 📊 Dashboards as a Visual Radiator

Dashboards provided:
- Real-time project status
- Category-level progress
- Work-in-progress limits
- Clear signals to leadership

Stakeholders did not need updates—they could **see progress live**.

## ⚡ Immediate Business Value

Once approved, copy was:
- Published directly to production
- Reflected immediately on PDPs
- Available to AI search systems without delay

This ensured the business benefited continuously throughout the project lifecycle.
