# Governance Model

This document defines **decision rights and quality gates**.

- For *how work moves through stages*, see: `process-overview.md`
- For *how Monday.com implements this system*, see: `monday-workflows.md`

Governance exists to ensure SEO improvements are:
- accurate
- brand-consistent
- compliant
- maintainable over time

---

## 👥 Stakeholder Involvement

Each product passed through review by:
- Marketing
- Dealer Sales
- Direct Sales

This prevented:
- Misaligned messaging
- Technical inaccuracies
- Post-launch rework

---

## ✅ Definition of Done

A product was considered complete only when:

- All four description types were finalized
- Feedback was incorporated
- Copy was live in production
- Status was updated in the tracking system

This avoided partial completion and ambiguity.

---

## 🧭 Change Management

Governance ensured that:
- Future updates followed the same standards
- New products could inherit the system
- SEO quality did not degrade over time

SEO became a **maintained capability**, not a one-time project.
