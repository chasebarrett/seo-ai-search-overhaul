# Process Overview (Agile / Kanban)

This project was executed using an Agile, Kanban-style workflow designed to optimize for:

- **Flow efficiency** (work moves consistently, not in large batches)
- **Fast feedback** (stakeholders review early and often)
- **Continuous delivery** (approved copy ships directly to production)
- **Quality at scale** (standards + review loops prevent drift)

Rather than treating SEO as a one-time deliverable, we treated it as an **iterative content system**.

## 🧩 Work Item Definition

Each product moved through the workflow as a single work item, with **four required outputs**:

1. PDP Copy  
2. Short Description  
3. Meta Description  
4. Workbook Copy  

A product was not considered “done” until all four outputs were approved and published.

## 🧠 Kanban Workflow (Pull-Based)

Work was managed on a Kanban board to make status visible and reduce bottlenecks.

### Why Kanban Worked Here
- Work requests arrived continuously (not in a single backlog dump)
- Stakeholder review capacity fluctuated week-to-week
- We needed **flow and throughput**, not rigid sprint commitments
- We wanted to limit WIP to prevent half-finished products piling up

### Typical Stages
- **Ready for Draft**
- **Drafting**
- **Stakeholder Review**
- **Revisions**
- **Approved**
- **Live in Production**

## 🔁 Feedback Loops (Iterative Refinement)

Stakeholder feedback was treated as a formal loop, not an ad-hoc interruption.

### Feedback Loop Pattern
1. Drafts generated (AI-assisted)
2. Stakeholders reviewed for:
   - accuracy
   - voice
   - differentiation
   - compliance considerations
3. Feedback incorporated and re-circulated quickly
4. Once approved, copy shipped to production immediately

This reduced rework and created alignment because stakeholders could see their input reflected in near real-time.

## 🚀 Continuous Delivery to Production

Instead of waiting to “finish a batch,” this project used **continuous delivery**:

- Once a product’s copy was approved, it was **updated directly in production**
- The business started receiving value immediately
- Learnings from early releases improved later drafts (compounding quality)

This approach minimized the risk of a long project producing delayed outcomes.

## 📊 Transparency & Flow Metrics

A shared dashboard acted as a visual radiator so stakeholders could see:

- how many products were in each stage
- where work was blocked (often review capacity)
- progress by category (Ski, Climb, etc.)
- overall throughput over time

This visibility reduced status-meeting overhead and improved stakeholder trust.

## ✅ Summary

The operating model was intentionally lightweight:

- **Kanban for flow**
- **Feedback loops for quality**
- **Continuous delivery for value**
- **Dashboards for transparency**
